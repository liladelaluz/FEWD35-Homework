Great job with the assignment. I only have a few notes:

1) Your code is really organized, really good job with spacing, sections, and lables for classes and IDs.

2) You hit everything but a few minor details. For the about me page, the resume link doesn't work and that section is off center, and the pipes to the right of your links need more spacing.

3) On the resume portion, everything looks good except there you're missing the square bullets for list items. Try using list-style: square to achieve this effect.

Keep up the good work!
