		This series revolves around four, older single women (three widows and one divorcee) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcee Dorthy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded toa room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5]The three women were soon joined by Dorthy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Eselle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[6][7]
